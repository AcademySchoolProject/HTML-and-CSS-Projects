		<p>Here is a cute fact about pandas:</p>
		
		<blockquote cite="https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/fascinating-facts/pandas">
		The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.
		Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats. 
		The arms and legs are black, helping it to hide in shade.
